### Summary â€“ 
As part of the final project of the DS-1 course at Univ.AI, we used the YELP dataset and created a database 'restaurants.db' which stores the tables for review, user, checkin and tip data in the respective tables. We did data pre-processing and EDA on all the tables in database and built a collaborative filtering based restaurant recommender system using Stochastic Gradient Descent.
